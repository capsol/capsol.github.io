<h2>What is CapSol?</h2>

<p>
CapSol combines the potential of graphene and porous silicon to enhance supercapacitor technology. It offers a solution to the problem of effectively storing large amounts of electrical energy over a prolonged duration. The porous silicon by itself is too volatile a material to be used in supercapacitors, as it reacts with chemicals that produce an electric charge; thus it needs to be coated with a film of graphene. This layer of graphene can then be exposed to a chemical process known as doping, enhancing its conductivity and storage capabilities. The fusion of both silicon and graphene in CapSol has an energy density two orders of magnitude greater than commercially-available pure silicon or pure graphene supercapacitors, and is a more elegant and cleaner solution in the long run.

<h2>Why CapSol?</h2>
<img class="alightleft" src="http://www.majhost.com/gallery/moony/CapSol/solar.gif" width="222" height="216" alt="" align="middle">
<p>The marriage of graphene and porous silicon for supercapacitors provide a superior long-term alternative to energy storage in solar cells. While solar panels can last with conventional power sources, they lack storage and waste extra energy.  So far, deep-cycle batteries have been used, but they possess disadvantages. Some batteries have a "memory effect‚Äù, in which  they lose the ability to sustain a charge over a long period of time. This clearly becomes a problem when desiring long-lasting energy containment and production. They also harbor severe environmental concerns and thus are not a considerable alternative in the long-run.  Graphene's high energy density, relatively small size, and minimal impact on the ecosystem, fused with the simplicity and conductive powers of porous silicon, provides a cleaner and more elegant solution to the dilemma of solar power.</p>
